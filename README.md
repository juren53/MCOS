# MCIS - Museum Collections Information System

_High Level Project Plan_

## 1. Project Overview
MCIS will be a free, open source museum collections information system designed specifically for small, budget-constrained museums, historical societies, and specialized collections. It will provide professional-grade collections management without the cost or complexity of commercial solutions such as PastPerfect, Argus, or The Museum System (TMS).

The system will be built on a two-tier public/private architecture:

*   **Public Tier** — Selected collection records and artifact images will be published to the museum's Internet Archive (IA) collections, providing free, permanent, searchable public access aligned with the GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, Museums) open access movement.
*   **Private Tier** — Full operational data will be maintained in a secure, self-hosted SQL database covering collections management, donor records, loans, member communications, and internal inventory.

## 2. Goals & Guiding Principles

| Principle                 | Description                                                                     |
| :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Free & Open Source        | No licensing fees. Community-developed and maintained under an open source license. |
| Affordable to Deploy      | Will run on modest hardware the museum already owns, or a low-cost VPS.       |
| Simple to Operate         | Low training curve for volunteers and part-time staff with high turnover.       |
| Multi-User Ready          | PyQt6 desktop clients will connect to a shared SQL server — standard client/server architecture. |
| Modular by Design         | Each functional area will be a standalone module. Museums can adopt incrementally. |
| Data Portable             | Museums will own their data. No vendor lock-in. Standard SQL exports.           |
| Public Access Built In    | Internet Archive publishing will be a first-class feature, not an afterthought.   |
| Grant Friendly            | Open access commitment and IMLS-aligned mission will support grant applications. |

## 3. Target Users

*   Small local historical societies operating on volunteer labor
*   Community art museums and galleries with limited IT support
*   Specialized collections (science, natural history, transportation, military) without dedicated registrars
*   Educational institutions managing teaching collections
*   Any museum currently managing collections in Excel spreadsheets or paper records

## 4. System Architecture

### 4.1 Technology Stack

| Layer             | Technology                 | Rationale                                                                      |
| :---------------- | :------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Desktop Client    | Python / PyQt6             | Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS). Proven in institutional deployments.   |
| Database Server   | PostgreSQL                 | Robust concurrent multi-user access. Free, open source, widely supported.      |
| ORM / DB Layer    | SQLAlchemy                 | Pythonic database abstraction. Supports future DB backend flexibility.         |
| IA Publishing     | internetarchive Python library | Official IA library for bulk upload and metadata management.                     |
| Packaging         | PyInstaller                | Cross-platform executable distribution for Windows and Linux.                  |

### 4.2 Deployment Model

The SQL database server will run on one dedicated machine the museum already owns (or an inexpensive VPS). Staff and volunteers will install the lightweight PyQt6 client on their individual workstations. No web browser, no web server, and no complex middleware will be required.

The Internet Archive publishing module will run as part of the desktop client, batching approved records and images to the museum's IA collection via the official API.

## 5. Module Architecture

MCIS will be built as a modular system. Each module will be able to run standalone or integrated into the full MCIS shell. This will allow museums to start with only what they need and expand over time.

### 5.1 Core Shell

The Core Shell will be the foundation that all modules plug into. It will not be optional.

*   Database connection configuration and connection pooling
*   User authentication and role-based access control (Admin, Registrar, Staff, Volunteer, Read-Only)
*   Module enable/disable per installation
*   Shared navigation, consistent UI patterns, and application settings
*   Audit logging of record changes

### 5.2 Collections Modules

## 8. Competitive Landscape

| System                     | Cost                | Target Size | Open Source | IA Integration   |
| :------------------------- | :------------------ | :---------- | :---------- | :--------------- |
| PastPerfect Online         | Subscription fee    | Small–Mid   | No          | No               |
| Argus                      | Enterprise pricing  | Mid–Large   | No          | No               |
| The Museum System (TMS)    | Enterprise pricing  | Large       | No          | No               |
| CollectiveAccess           | Free                | Small–Large | Yes         | No               |
| MCIS (proposed)            | Free                | Small       | Yes         | Yes — built in   |

CollectiveAccess is the closest open source peer, but it is a web-based PHP application requiring a web server — a significant deployment burden for small museums with no IT staff. MCIS will target an even simpler deployment model and will make Internet Archive publishing a first-class feature.

## 9. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk                                                           | Mitigation                                                                                                   |
| :------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Single developer bus factor                                    | Clear documentation, open source community building, modular architecture makes contributions accessible     |
| PyQt6 licensing (GPL)                                          | Review GPL compliance for distribution; consider PyQt6 commercial license or migration to PySide6 (LGPL) if needed |
| PostgreSQL deployment complexity for non-technical museums     | Provide Docker Compose option and step-by-step setup guides; consider SQLite as a single-user fallback     |
| Internet Archive API changes                                   | Pin to stable IA library version; abstract the publish interface so backends can be swapped                |
| Scope creep                                                    | Strict module boundaries and phased roadmap keep development focused                                         |

## 10. Immediate Next Steps

*   Create GitHub repository: mcis or open-mcis
*   Draft README with project mission, architecture overview, and contributing guide
*   Choose open source license (GPL v3 or MIT — note PyQt6 GPL implications)
*   Design initial database schema for Collections and Objects modules
*   Build Core Shell skeleton: DB connection, user login, module loader
*   Identify one pilot museum willing to test early releases
