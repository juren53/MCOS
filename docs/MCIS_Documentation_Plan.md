## Notes

- User guides will be written module-by-module as each Phase reaches completion, not in advance. Writing user documentation before the UI is final produces documentation that immediately needs rewriting.
- The Deployment Guide is the highest-priority planned document — it is needed before any pilot institution can begin testing Phase 1.
- Schema documents for Phases 3–5 (Operations, Community, Data Migration) will be drafted as those phases are scoped. They are not planned at this time.
