# MCIS Phase 2 Schema Design

_Draft Version 0.1 — 2026-06-16_

Schema for the entities required by Phase 2 (Collections Modules): Locations, Loans, LoanObjects, and Donors. Also documents the migrations that extend Phase 1 tables once these entities exist.

All conventions established in [schema_phase1.md](schema_phase1.md) apply here. This document notes only additions or deviations.

---

## Phase 1 migrations

The following changes are applied to existing Phase 1 tables at the start of Phase 2, once the new tables they reference have been created.

### objects — add FK constraint on location_id

```sql
ALTER TABLE objects
    ADD CONSTRAINT fk_objects_location
    FOREIGN KEY (location_id) REFERENCES locations(location_id)
    ON DELETE RESTRICT;
```

`location_id` was included in the Phase 1 `objects` table as a nullable INTEGER with no FK. This migration adds the constraint. `ON DELETE RESTRICT` prevents a location from being deleted while objects are assigned to it.

### objects — add donor_id

```sql
ALTER TABLE objects
    ADD COLUMN donor_id INTEGER
    REFERENCES donors(donor_id) ON DELETE SET NULL;
```

Links an object to its primary donor. `ON DELETE SET NULL` means deleting a donor record does not delete the object — the link is cleared and the provenance field retains the narrative history. A junction table for co-donations (multiple donors per object) is a future enhancement.

## 1. locations

Represents physical and logical places where objects are stored or displayed. Supports a parent/child hierarchy — a Room contains Cases; a Case contains individual positions.

| Column           | Type         | Constraints                                                          | Description                                                        |

| name             | VARCHAR(255) | NOT NULL                                                             | Display name, e.g. "Gallery A", "Case 3", "Off-site Storage Unit" |
| location_code    | VARCHAR(50)  | UNIQUE                                                               | Short code for labelling and signage, e.g. "GA-C3-P5". Optional.  |
| location_type    | VARCHAR(20)  | NOT NULL CHECK (location_type IN ('Room','Case','Storage','Offsite'))| Physical classification of the location                            |
| parent_location_id | INTEGER    | REFERENCES locations(location_id) ON DELETE RESTRICT                 | Parent location in the hierarchy. NULL for top-level locations.    |
| description      | TEXT         |                                                                      | Narrative description of the location                              |
| notes            | TEXT         |                                                                      | Operational notes (climate control, access restrictions, etc.)     |
| is_active        | BOOLEAN      | NOT NULL DEFAULT TRUE                                                | Inactive locations cannot receive objects but history is retained  |
| created_at       | TIMESTAMPTZ  | NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()                                               |                                                                    |
| updated_at       | TIMESTAMPTZ  | NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()                                               |                                                                    |

**Indexes:**
- `parent_location_id` — hierarchy traversal
- `location_type` — filter by type
- `is_active` — exclude retired locations from active lookups

**Notes:**
- The hierarchy is intentionally shallow in typical use: Building → Room → Case → Position. Deep nesting is supported but not required.
- `ON DELETE RESTRICT` on the self-referential FK prevents deleting a parent location while child locations exist.
- Objects on loan are assigned to the borrower's location record (a location of type `Offsite`), not tracked separately. The Loans table carries the borrower contact details.
- Setting `is_active = FALSE` retires a location without removing its history from object location records.
- `name` has no uniqueness constraint. Duplicate names under the same parent are technically allowed. Consider enforcing uniqueness at the application level, or adding `UNIQUE (name, parent_location_id)` noting that PostgreSQL treats two NULLs as distinct, so duplicate top-level names would not be caught by that constraint.

## 2. loans

Records an outgoing or incoming loan agreement at the header level. The specific objects covered by each loan are tracked in `loan_objects`.

| status              | VARCHAR(10)    | NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Pending' CHECK (status IN ('Pending','Active','Returned','Cancelled'))           | Lifecycle status. Overdue is computed on-the-fly: `end_date < CURRENT_DATE AND status = 'Active'` |
| created_at          | TIMESTAMPTZ    | NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()                                                                 |                                                                      |

**Indexes:**
- `loan_type` — filter outgoing vs incoming
- `status` — active loan dashboard and overdue alerts
- `end_date` — deadline alert queries (`WHERE end_date < NOW() AND status = 'Active'`)
- `counterparty_name` — search by institution

**Notes:**
- `counterparty_name` and `counterparty_contact` store the external party for both loan types. For outgoing loans this is the borrower; for incoming loans this is the lender.
- `insurance_value` covers the full loan. Per-object insurance values, if needed, are a future enhancement on `loan_objects`.
- `insurance_value` and `insurance_currency` are both nullable. When `insurance_value` is set, `insurance_currency` should also be set; the application enforces this pairing.
- Overdue state is not stored — it is computed on-the-fly as `end_date < CURRENT_DATE AND status = 'Active'`. This avoids a stored value drifting out of sync with the actual date.
- Loan agreements (PDF files) should be stored in the media directory and referenced by `agreement_ref`, not stored as BLOBs in the database.

## 3. loan_objects

Junction table linking loans to the specific objects they cover. Also records the condition of each object at departure and return.

| Column             | Type         | Constraints                                                                   | Description                                                         |

| object_id          | INTEGER      | NOT NULL REFERENCES objects(object_id) ON DELETE RESTRICT                     | Object covered by the loan                                          |
| condition_out      | VARCHAR(20)  | CHECK (condition_out IN ('Excellent','Good','Fair','Poor','Unknown'))          | Condition grade recorded when object left the museum                |
| condition_out_notes| TEXT         |                                                                               | Narrative condition notes at departure                              |
| condition_in       | VARCHAR(20)  | CHECK (condition_in IN ('Excellent','Good','Fair','Poor','Unknown'))           | Condition grade recorded when object was returned                   |
| condition_in_notes | TEXT         |                                                                               | Narrative condition notes at return                                 |
| notes              | TEXT         |                                                                               | Per-object handling instructions for this loan, e.g. "display upright only" |
| returned_at        | TIMESTAMPTZ  |                                                                               | Timestamp the object was checked back in. NULL while still on loan. |
| created_at         | TIMESTAMPTZ  | NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()                                                        | When this object was added to the loan                              |

**Table constraint:** `UNIQUE (loan_id, object_id)` — an object cannot appear twice on the same loan.

**Indexes:**
- `object_id` — find all loans (past and present) for a given object

**Notes:**
- `ON DELETE RESTRICT` on both FKs: a loan cannot be deleted while it has objects, and an object cannot be deleted while it is on a loan record. Cancelling a loan sets `status = 'Cancelled'` on the `loans` row rather than deleting it.
- `condition_out` should be recorded before the object leaves. `condition_in` is recorded at return. Both are nullable to allow partial completion.
- The condition vocabulary matches `objects.condition` deliberately. Any future change to the allowed values must be applied consistently across both tables.
- `returned_at` is set when the last object on a loan is checked back in; the application should then set `loans.status = 'Returned'`.

## 4. donors

Contact records for individuals and organisations who have donated objects to the collection.

**Indexes:**
- `name` — donor search
- `acknowledgment_sent` — filter for pending acknowledgments

**Notes:**
- `email`, `phone`, and `address` are PII and must be handled according to the data retention policy described in the deployment guide. Consider whether these fields should be encrypted at rest.
- `is_anonymous` suppresses the donor name in public-facing contexts (IA publishing, public labels) but the full record is retained internally.
- `gift_restrictions` applies to all objects donated by this donor. Per-object restrictions are tracked in `objects.provenance` at this stage; a separate `restrictions` table is a future enhancement.
- `acknowledgment_sent` / `acknowledgment_date` track the most recent acknowledgment. A donor who makes multiple gifts will need the acknowledgment flags reset after each new gift — a full gift history table is a Phase 4 candidate.
- Add table-level CHECK: `CHECK (acknowledgment_date IS NULL OR acknowledgment_sent = TRUE)` to prevent `acknowledgment_date` being set without `acknowledgment_sent`.
- The link from a donated object back to its donor is `objects.donor_id` (added by Phase 2 migration above). Multiple donors per object is not supported in Phase 2.

## Deferred to Phase 3

The following are out of scope for Phase 2 and will be addressed in the Phase 3 schema document:

- IA Publisher queue table (tracks publish jobs and their status)
- Any schema changes required to support batch IA metadata mapping
