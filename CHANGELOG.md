## [2026-06-16-1312] — High-Level Plan Revised for Advisory Board

### Changed
- `docs/MCIS_High_Level_Plan.md` — major revision (v0.1 → v0.2) to target a senior museum director and archivist advisory board audience:
  - Added "The problem MCIS addresses" framing paragraph to §1
  - Added "What these institutions have in common" to §3 (Target Institutions)
  - Restructured §4 as "What MCIS Will Do" — reframed from module names to collections-operations capabilities
  - **Added §5 Standards Alignment** — SPECTRUM, Dublin Core, LIDO, AAM Core Standards, IMLS Data Stewardship; how MCIS aligns with each
  - Rewrote §6 Technology Overview — simplified rationale in plain language; added "what it means for your institution" framing; added single-user SQLite fallback note and data ownership paragraph
  - Updated §7 Phase 0 milestone to reflect current progress (schema and use cases complete)
  - **Added §8 Current Status** — table showing completion state of each Phase 0 deliverable
  - **Added §9 Advisory Board** — advisory board role, what members are being asked to review now, and how to provide feedback
  - Updated §10 Competitive Landscape — more nuanced CollectiveAccess comparison
  - Added "adoption by target institutions" and "schema decisions diverge from practice" risks to §11
  - Added AAM, SPECTRUM to §12 Glossary; updated TMS description (Gallery Systems → Axiell)
  - Renumbered sections (Competitive Landscape is now §10, Risks §11, Glossary §12)

## [2026-06-16-1309] — Remove Stale HTML Source

### Removed
- `docs/MCIS_High_Level_Plan.html` — original LibreOffice export; superseded by `docs/MCIS_High_Level_Plan.md` which is the living document going forward

---

## [2026-06-16-1302] — Phase 1 Schema Critique Fixes

### Changed
- `docs/schema_phase1.md`:
  - Added `maker VARCHAR(255)` to `objects` — artist, maker, manufacturer, or creator; free text with note on controlled vocabulary as a future enhancement
  - Added `condition_date DATE` to `objects` — structured date of most recent condition assessment; replaces embedding dates in `condition_notes` free text
  - Added `UNIQUE` constraint to `media.file_path` — prevents two records referencing the same physical file (storage accounting and safe delete)
  - Added `finding_aid_is_url BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE` to `collections` — explicit URL vs free-text flag; avoids heuristic URL detection in the UI
  - Added single-role limitation note to `users` — one role per user; junction table path documented if combined roles are needed in future
  - Added `ia_identifier` assignment timing note to `objects` — NULL until Phase 3 upload succeeds; assigned by IA API, not by the registrar
  - Added accepted MIME types list to `media` notes — `image/jpeg`, `image/tiff`, `image/png`, `image/gif`, `application/pdf`; video and audio deferred
  - Added single-collection UX note to `collections` — UI should pre-select the only collection when one exists rather than requiring user to choose from a one-item list
  - Updated document timestamp

  - Added `ia_queued` index to `objects`
  - Documented cascade-delete audit policy: parent DELETE is logged with full row snapshot; cascaded child rows are not individually logged
- `docs/use_cases/UC-Phase1-Objects.md`:

  - Dependency citations added to all UC-MED UCs
- `docs/use_cases/UC-Phase1-Users.md`:
  - UC-USR-003/UC-USR-005 ordering conflict documented in preconditions of both UCs (tbright must be active for UC-USR-005)

## [2026-06-16-1115] — Schema Design Phase 2 + Critique Fixes

### Added
- `docs/schema_phase2.md` — Phase 2 schema design covering `locations`, `loans`, `loan_objects`, and `donors`; includes Phase 1 migrations (location_id FK, donor_id on objects), full column definitions with types, constraints, indexes, entity relationship diagram, and deferred-to-Phase-3 section
- `CHANGELOG.md` — project changelog built from all existing commits using Keep a Changelog format

### Changed
- `docs/schema_phase2.md` — first critique pass:
  - Added `location_code VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE` to `locations` for labelling and signage
  - Added note on `locations.name` uniqueness limitations at the same hierarchy level
  - Removed `NOT NULL` from `loans.insurance_currency` (nullable when `insurance_value` is null)
  - Removed `'Overdue'` from `loans.status` CHECK constraint — overdue now computed on-the-fly as `end_date < CURRENT_DATE AND status = 'Active'`
  - Added `purpose TEXT` to `loans`
  - Added `notes TEXT` and `created_at TIMESTAMPTZ` to `loan_objects`
  - Promoted `UNIQUE (loan_id, object_id)` from index note to formal table constraint
  - Added `donor_type VARCHAR(20)` to `donors` to distinguish Individual from Organization
  - Clarified `name`/`organization` field semantics based on `donor_type`
  - Added `is_active BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT TRUE` to `donors`
  - Added `acknowledgment CHECK` constraint note to `donors`
  - Fixed entity relationship diagram — `loans` and `objects` are now correctly shown as co-parents of `loan_objects`
- `docs/schema_phase2.md` — second critique pass:
  - Removed `DEFAULT 'USD'` from `loans.insurance_currency` — no default; application always writes both fields together
  - Added `start_date` index to `loans` for fiscal-year and date-range queries
  - Added `updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ` to `loan_objects` (table has mutable columns — condition_in, returned_at, notes)
  - Clarified multi-object loan return condition: set `loans.status = 'Returned'` only when all `loan_objects.returned_at` are non-NULL
  - Promoted `donors` acknowledgment CHECK from note to actual table-level constraint
  - Added bottom-up deletion note to `locations` (RESTRICT requires children deleted before parent)
  - Restored `audit_log` to Phase 2 cumulative ER diagram; restructured diagram for clarity
- `docs/schema_phase1.md` — addressed critique points:
  - Added `ON DELETE RESTRICT` as the default FK behaviour convention
  - Added UTF-8 encoding convention
  - Moved `updated_at` auto-maintenance note from `collections` to Conventions
  - Added `ON DELETE RESTRICT` to `objects.collection_id` FK
  - Added `credit_line TEXT` to `objects` (public attribution, distinct from provenance)
  - Added `rights_statement TEXT` to `objects` (Phase 3 Internet Archive dependency)
  - Renamed `media.upload_date` to `created_at` for consistency across all tables
  - Added `original_filename VARCHAR(255)` to `media`
  - Added `file_size BIGINT` to `media`
  - Added `sort_order INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0` to `media`
  - Changed `audit_log.record_id` from `INTEGER` to `BIGINT`
- `docs/MCIS_High_Level_Plan.md` — clarified deployment model in §4.2:
  - Database runs in a virtual isolated environment on existing hardware
  - Client install uses standard OS-specific installation processes
- Timestamps updated on plan and schema documents

---

## [2026-06-15-0319] — Phase 1 Schema Design

### Added

### Changed
- `README.md` — deployment sentence reworded to be role-neutral ("A lightweight desktop client can be installed on a laptop or workstation")

---

  - Split Phase 1 into Phase 0 (Project Infrastructure) and Phase 1 (Core Framework)
  - Renamed misplaced §7.6 Data Conversion to Phase 6 — Data Migration with correct heading
  - Added milestone acceptance criteria to every phase
  - Updated competitive table: "proposed" → "in development"
  - Added backup/recovery and donor/member PII risks to Section 9
  - Marked completed items in Immediate Next Steps
  - Added Section 11 Glossary (10 terms)
  - Added Data Conversion section (later promoted to Phase 6)
- `README.md`:
  - Rewritten as a concise project summary; detailed content moved to plan document
  - Renamed "What it will do" section to "Overview"
  - Added framing sentence before two-tier architecture description
  - Added deployment context paragraph (client/server, no web server required)
