---

## [2026-06-16-1451] — README Critique Fixes

### Changed
- `README.md` — seven critique points addressed:

---

## [2026-06-16-1417] — Address Second Plan Critique Pass (v0.5)

### Changed
- `docs/MCIS_High_Level_Plan.md` — seven critique points addressed:
  - §4 opening claim rewritten — differentiator is IA publishing specifically, not all of Phase 1
  - Phase 0 use case bullet reworded: "a collection of use cases documenting operational workflows for every module"
  - macOS added to Phase 2 packaged installer (was inconsistent with §6 technology table)
  - "Advisory board [TBD] engagement begun" → "Advisory board [TBD] — formation underway"
  - §10 IA API risk mitigation rewritten in plain language (removed "abstract the publish interface")

  - All "advisory board" references updated to "advisory board [TBD]" — group is planned but not yet formally constituted
  - "AAM Core Standards" corrected to cite the actual document: *National Standards and Best Practices for U.S. Museums* (AAM, 2008)
  - "no vendor who can hold the data hostage" replaced with "no cloud dependency, no subscription, no vendor lock-in"
  - Phase numbers removed from §4 subheadings — eliminates the Phase 3 → Phase 5 gap (Phase 4 is a project phase, not a feature set)
  - Phase 4 jargon cleaned up: "Plugin API" → "extension framework"; "ReadTheDocs or GitHub Pages" → "public documentation website"
  - "internetarchive library" → "Internet Archive API" in technology table
  - CIDOC CRM and VPS removed from glossary — unreferenced in document body

### Changed
- `docs/MCIS_High_Level_Plan.md` — removed "IMLS and foundation grant applications leveraging open access mission" from Phase 4 deliverables; vague aspirational boilerplate for an audience that knows the grant landscape; "Grant Friendly" principle in §2 carries that message adequately

---

### Changed
- `docs/MCIS_High_Level_Plan.md` — v0.2 → v0.3; Internet Archive publishing moved from standalone Phase 3 into Phase 1 as a core capability:
  - §2 "Public Access Built In" principle updated — publishing available from Phase 1
  - §4 Phase 1 section renamed "Collections, Objects & Internet Archive Publishing — Phase 1"; added Basic IA Publisher bullet (flag → approve → upload primary image + core metadata → write-back ia_identifier)

---

## [2026-06-16-1324] — Simplify Accessible by Design Principle

### Changed
- `docs/MCIS_High_Level_Plan.md` — "Accessible by Design" principle reworded to "UI will be cross-platform and standards-based"; removed WCAG 2.1 AA reference (web standard, not applicable to a desktop app; jargon for this audience)

---

## [2026-06-16-1316] — Remove Advisory Board Section from Plan

### Changed
- `docs/MCIS_High_Level_Plan.md` — removed §9 Advisory Board (group is informal and dynamic; no need to document it in the plan); renumbered Competitive Landscape, Risks, and Glossary as §9–11

---

## [2026-06-16-1312] — High-Level Plan Revised for Advisory Board

### Changed
- `docs/MCIS_High_Level_Plan.md` — major revision (v0.1 → v0.2) to target a senior museum director and archivist advisory board audience:
  - Added "The problem MCIS addresses" framing paragraph to §1
  - Added "What these institutions have in common" to §3 (Target Institutions)
  - Restructured §4 as "What MCIS Will Do" — reframed from module names to collections-operations capabilities
  - **Added §5 Standards Alignment** — SPECTRUM, Dublin Core, LIDO, AAM Core Standards, IMLS Data Stewardship; how MCIS aligns with each

  - **Added §9 Advisory Board** — advisory board role, what members are being asked to review now, and how to provide feedback
  - Updated §10 Competitive Landscape — more nuanced CollectiveAccess comparison
  - Added "adoption by target institutions" and "schema decisions diverge from practice" risks to §11
  - Added AAM, SPECTRUM to §12 Glossary; updated TMS description (Gallery Systems → Axiell)
  - Renumbered sections (Competitive Landscape is now §10, Risks §11, Glossary §12)

---

## [2026-06-16-1309] — Remove Stale HTML Source

### Removed
- `docs/MCIS_High_Level_Plan.html` — original LibreOffice export; superseded by `docs/MCIS_High_Level_Plan.md` which is the living document going forward

---

## [2026-06-16-1302] — Phase 1 Schema Critique Fixes

### Changed
- `docs/schema_phase1.md`:
  - Added `maker VARCHAR(255)` to `objects` — artist, maker, manufacturer, or creator; free text with note on controlled vocabulary as a future enhancement
  - Added `condition_date DATE` to `objects` — structured date of most recent condition assessment; replaces embedding dates in `condition_notes` free text
  - Added `UNIQUE` constraint to `media.file_path` — prevents two records referencing the same physical file (storage accounting and safe delete)
  - Added `finding_aid_is_url BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE` to `collections` — explicit URL vs free-text flag; avoids heuristic URL detection in the UI
  - Added single-role limitation note to `users` — one role per user; junction table path documented if combined roles are needed in future
  - Added `ia_identifier` assignment timing note to `objects` — NULL until Phase 3 upload succeeds; assigned by IA API, not by the registrar
  - Added accepted MIME types list to `media` notes — `image/jpeg`, `image/tiff`, `image/png`, `image/gif`, `application/pdf`; video and audio deferred
  - Added single-collection UX note to `collections` — UI should pre-select the only collection when one exists rather than requiring user to choose from a one-item list
  - Updated document timestamp

---

## [2026-06-16-1115] — Schema Design Phase 2 + Critique Fixes

### Added
- `docs/schema_phase2.md` — Phase 2 schema design covering `locations`, `loans`, `loan_objects`, and `donors`; includes Phase 1 migrations (location_id FK, donor_id on objects), full column definitions with types, constraints, indexes, entity relationship diagram, and deferred-to-Phase-3 section
- `CHANGELOG.md` — project changelog built from all existing commits using Keep a Changelog format

### Changed
- `docs/schema_phase2.md` — first critique pass:
  - Added `location_code VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE` to `locations` for labelling and signage
  - Added note on `locations.name` uniqueness limitations at the same hierarchy level
  - Removed `NOT NULL` from `loans.insurance_currency` (nullable when `insurance_value` is null)
  - Removed `'Overdue'` from `loans.status` CHECK constraint — overdue now computed on-the-fly as `end_date < CURRENT_DATE AND status = 'Active'`
  - Added `purpose TEXT` to `loans`
  - Added `notes TEXT` and `created_at TIMESTAMPTZ` to `loan_objects`
  - Promoted `UNIQUE (loan_id, object_id)` from index note to formal table constraint
  - Added `donor_type VARCHAR(20)` to `donors` to distinguish Individual from Organization
  - Clarified `name`/`organization` field semantics based on `donor_type`
  - Added `is_active BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT TRUE` to `donors`
  - Added `acknowledgment CHECK` constraint note to `donors`
  - Fixed entity relationship diagram — `loans` and `objects` are now correctly shown as co-parents of `loan_objects`
- `docs/schema_phase2.md` — second critique pass:
  - Removed `DEFAULT 'USD'` from `loans.insurance_currency` — no default; application always writes both fields together
  - Added `start_date` index to `loans` for fiscal-year and date-range queries
  - Added `updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ` to `loan_objects` (table has mutable columns — condition_in, returned_at, notes)
  - Clarified multi-object loan return condition: set `loans.status = 'Returned'` only when all `loan_objects.returned_at` are non-NULL
  - Promoted `donors` acknowledgment CHECK from note to actual table-level constraint
  - Added bottom-up deletion note to `locations` (RESTRICT requires children deleted before parent)
  - Restored `audit_log` to Phase 2 cumulative ER diagram; restructured diagram for clarity
- `docs/schema_phase1.md` — addressed critique points:
  - Added `ON DELETE RESTRICT` as the default FK behaviour convention
  - Added UTF-8 encoding convention
  - Moved `updated_at` auto-maintenance note from `collections` to Conventions
  - Added `ON DELETE RESTRICT` to `objects.collection_id` FK
  - Added `credit_line TEXT` to `objects` (public attribution, distinct from provenance)
  - Added `rights_statement TEXT` to `objects` (Phase 3 Internet Archive dependency)
  - Renamed `media.upload_date` to `created_at` for consistency across all tables
  - Added `original_filename VARCHAR(255)` to `media`
  - Added `file_size BIGINT` to `media`
  - Added `sort_order INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0` to `media`
  - Changed `audit_log.record_id` from `INTEGER` to `BIGINT`
- `docs/MCIS_High_Level_Plan.md` — clarified deployment model in §4.2:
  - Database runs in a virtual isolated environment on existing hardware
  - Client install uses standard OS-specific installation processes
- Timestamps updated on plan and schema documents

## [2026-06-15-0319] — Phase 1 Schema Design

### Added
- `docs/schema_phase1.md` — Phase 1 schema design covering `collections`, `objects`, `media`, `users`, and `audit_log`; includes conventions table, full column definitions with types/constraints/notes, indexes, design decision rationale, entity relationships diagram, and deferred-to-Phase-2 section

### Changed
- `README.md` — deployment sentence reworded to be role-neutral ("A lightweight desktop client can be installed on a laptop or workstation")

---

## [2026-06-14-2200] — Project Documentation

### Added
- `docs/MCIS_High_Level_Plan.md` — full high-level project plan converted from HTML source; covers project overview, goals and guiding principles, target users, system architecture, module architecture, core database entities, phased development plan (Phases 0–6), competitive landscape, risks and mitigations, immediate next steps, and glossary
- `README.md` — concise project summary document linking to the full plan; covers overview, two-tier architecture, key principles, technology stack, project status, and getting-involved section

### Changed
- `docs/MCIS_High_Level_Plan.md`:
  - Applied future tense throughout to reflect in-development status
  - Added document version/date metadata subtitle
  - Switched desktop client from PyQt6 to PySide6 (LGPL v3) with licensing rationale
  - Added Accessible by Design principle to goals table
  - Added `Media` and `AuditLog` entities to Section 6
  - Fixed `Loan` entity to use a `LoanObject` junction table (was incorrectly 1:1 with Object)
  - Split Phase 1 into Phase 0 (Project Infrastructure) and Phase 1 (Core Framework)
  - Renamed misplaced §7.6 Data Conversion to Phase 6 — Data Migration with correct heading
  - Added milestone acceptance criteria to every phase
  - Updated competitive table: "proposed" → "in development"
  - Added backup/recovery and donor/member PII risks to Section 9
  - Marked completed items in Immediate Next Steps
  - Added Section 11 Glossary (10 terms)
  - Added Data Conversion section (later promoted to Phase 6)
- `README.md`:
  - Rewritten as a concise project summary; detailed content moved to plan document
  - Renamed "What it will do" section to "Overview"
  - Added framing sentence before two-tier architecture description
  - Added deployment context paragraph (client/server, no web server required)
  - Removed architecture fact from principles list
  - Renamed "ORM" row to "Database layer" for non-technical readers
  - Added GitHub URL to Getting Involved section
  - Reframed license uncertainty as a near-term commitment
  - Added Data Portable and Accessible by Design principles
